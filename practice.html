        <p>Upon several occasions throughout your career you will need to provide your potential employer with important information about your background and your qualifications. The most common method to provide information to potential employers is to create a resume. A resume can create a vivid word picture of yourself.</p>
        <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) has recently became more popular, and is often considered the newest form of popular media by many people. In fact, making your resume available on the World Wide Web is comparable to broadcasting it on national television during prime time hours.</p>
        <p>The most obvious benefit you will immediately receive by making your resume available on the Web is that you will reach an unlimited number of people and have opened new doors to audiences you would otherwise probably have never reached before. Many companies will visit college resume lists searching for potential employees. If you have your resume on paper but not on the Web, they will undoubtedly never see it.</p>
        <p>Another benefit of creating an electronic resume is cost. Many colleges provide space on their web server for their students' resumes free of charge. Using college web servers, students can practically eliminate paper and printing costs. Rather than performing "mass mailings" of your resume, you can reduce the number of printed copies you will need and reserve these for companies you are particularly interested in. Other benefits you will receive by creating an HTML resume include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the ability to provide electronic links to your reference and previous employers as well as providing links to previous jobs or projects you have been involved with</li>
            <li>the ability to make updates immediately available</li>
            <li>ease of maintainability</li>
            <li>the ability to show that you can adapt to, and use new technology as it becomes available (a "plus" to many employers)</li>
            <li>simply making your resume look more professional</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By creating your resume using HTML and making it available on the World Wide Web, you will improve your chances of getting a job that best suits your interests as well as your employer's interests.</p>
